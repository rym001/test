# Communication

**What are some of the internal communication problems that need to be addressed ... and what tools are they used to solve these problems?**

Too often with researchers requests, the approach is to press forward with finding solutions and resolving problems without following a particular method of communication, they only give the Advcomp team a phone call or go directy to their office. This engender that no trace is kept in any project management system and also a loss of information within the team.

In order to overcome these problems, to increase efficiency,to be productive wherever the Advcomp team is,and to simplify IT management, the Advcomp team uses a central portal called GitLab where all members can access all the relevant information, communication and documents in one place.

In more detail Gitlab is a project management tool that allows to create public or private projects, a public project will be seen and searchable by all the users of the system while a private project will correspond to a restricted group of users

Gitlab also features:

* **Issues with due-dates:** Project issues can have specific assignees and due-dates. Issues are basically a comment thread so you can keep posting updates on the task.
* **Milestones with due-dates:** Issues can be assigned a particular milestone â€” a release with specific features planned. The milestone usually has an overall due-date, so for a high-level overview of project status and progress, management can refer to project milestones. image avec creation d'une milestone
* **Shared Issue Boards for the Project:** Gitlab has also an issue boards that can be used to follow Kanban model. These boards are used with labels to split which column each issue ticket belongs to. Figure1 illustrates how this looks like on GitLab. Figure 1 is also used to demonstrate how Kanban works if used in GitLab.
* **mattermost for discussions:** GitLab is hooked up to mattermost for discussing solutions. All GitLab activity is logged in channels, so everyone in the team gets constant updates on project activity. People are pulled into discussions with mentions when necessary.

Also Advcomp team establish these 2 ways to interact with them:

1. Direct Email to the advcomp group: **advcom@qatar-med.cornell.edu**. The request will automatically be piled up for treatment. The request will be automatically created in the project management tool \(gitlab\) in an appropriate project as an issue. All members of the team will be notified of this request and will be able to hundle it. Gitlab will contain all the comments exchanged as well as the progress of the processing of the request, from its opening until its closure. Once the request is treated, the user will be informed by Email.
2. Use Microsoft teams: the advcomp team aims to work more and more in collaborative environments, microsoft team is the 100% Chat Collaborative Workspace in Office 365. Teams brings people, conversations and content together Team is a workspace orientated towards chat-based collaboration. Within a Team users create Channels to discuss specific topics and ideas. Tabs can also be added within a Team for quick access to certain files, apps \(such as Planner or SharePoint\) or external pages. When a Team is created, a Group is also generated with the same name. Features within a Team include:

* All the available tools within the created Group \(Inbox, Calendar, Document Library, Notebook, Team Site and Planner\).
* Persistent chat using Channels.
* Add tabs to the Team to access content quickly.

Teams can also be created and accessed by using the Outlook Web Access.

Using Teams allows to:

* Communicate in real time and make everyone aware
* Give quick access to the information the team needs

The Advcomp team has microsoft team installed and use it for internal communication. they organize communication by channels, where each channel correspond to a specific project. If a researcher for exemple has a request he can directly communicate with the Advcomp in a specific channel. microsoft team is also integrated into GitLab.
