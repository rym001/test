# Policies

The purpose of this Policy is to define the responsibilities of the Advcomp team on how to guide researchers managing the data, and enabling research data to be maintained and preserved as a first class research object and made available to the widest possible audience for the highest possible impact, according to the rights of everyone on these data of course.  
This policy is intended to ensure that research data created as part of the research process are:

* Accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;
* Attributable and citable;
* Identifiable, retrievable and available with minimal barriers;
* Secure from loss and degradation;
* Permanently stored even after publication;
* Compliant with legal obligations, ethical responsibilities and HIPAA.

### Policy Statements:

1. It is the policy of WCM-Q that its members can fulfil the requirements of good research practice by enabling them to manage research data in a manner that maximizes data impact and acknowledges data value as primary research output by its members.
2. It is the policy of WCM-Q that responsibility for managing and preserving research data is shared between all members of the College.
3. It is the policy of WCM-Q that following primary use \(e.g. publication\) or when research data is archived for long term preservation, these data will be made available in the most open manner appropriate.
4. It is the policy of WCM-Q that clear lines of responsibility are established so that research data generated at WCM-Q will always have an owner, responsible for preserving research data.

### Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources:

#### Biomedical Research:

or biomedical research, the WCM-Q currently runs clusters, totaling 86 nodes ranging from 2 to 56 cores distributed like this:

1 partition of 20 nodes. each node has 2 cores. Name= Multi2   
1 partition of 22 nodes. each node has 4 cores. Name= Multi4   
1 partition of 40 nodes. each node has 8 cores. Name= Multi8   
1 partition of 3 nodes. each node has 56 cores. Name= Bigmem56   
1 partition of 1 node. each node has 48 cores. Name= Bigmem48

#### Research data storage:

Data storage and preservation are key elements in the research data lifecycle, and the Advcomp team is responsible for maintaining and updating the Research Data.

The Advcomp team manages data storage in a centralized way for WCM-Q researchers needing somewhere to store and share their research data during the active phase of a research project. It consists of a large capacity networked facility suitable for all shapes and sizes of data, including very large files.

Rather than providing personal data storage, the service follows a project-based approach. Researchers can create projects, define the membership of that project, then upload and download files to and from the designated project space. Files are accessible only to named project members.

On the other hand, IT projects and the code written by the Advcomp team are permanently stored and organized in Gitlab where all project members can access them at any time.

#### Making Backups:

Advcomp team makes regular backups and stores data on multiple drives to protect them from the risk of damage or loss.
